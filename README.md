# Classroom-Organization-and-Assignment-Tool
Backend data processing tool that organizes courses based on their learning hall, time, and assigns classrooms using Excel Viewer for visualization. This project involves data processing, analysis, and visualization, and the focus will be on the backend processing and visualization layers.

Run the program by changing directories to ```Classroom-Organization-and-Assignment-Tool``` in the shell, ```cd Classroom-Organization-and-Assignment-Tool```. Then run ```python main.py``` in the shell.

The ```main.py``` files includes an instruction that calls the assignment instruction and prints it's results in the terminal.

Be sure to update the Assignment Class Variables in to match your file names, online course classroom output, and assigned building specfications. 

To view the vizualized version, you must have the ```Excel Viewer``` extension (or your extension of choice) added and follow the instructions in the documentation to visualize.
